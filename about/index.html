  <div class="container">
      
     <p>Born from the minds and ethos of the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x4kqcltm4vgo63y/Rave%20Ethics.pdf" target="_blank" >Rave Ethics zine</a>, Future Ethics is a women-run music label. We focus on creating progress, community, and beauty in dance music by giving platforms to visionaries prepared to fight for a future that is both sonically and ethically enlightened. At a minimum, the future ethics we envision are anti-racist, anti-sexist, and anti-capitalist.  We honor our dance-music forebears, those who grew the genre out of oppressed communities as a form of resistance, and we strive to highlight their fight as the true spirit of this music.</p> <br> 

      <p>   We believe in the potential of art—musical, visual, textual— to create social change, but it requires continuous (re)imagining of our future ethics. We must define our vision, reflect this vision in our actions and art, engage in dialogue to teach and be taught, and build the communities and spaces essential for progress. The spaces where future ethics are realized (parties, raves, protests) grow organically by being both militant and 
fun—communities draw strength from these spaces to go out and create and recreate them.  </p>  <br>

      <p>

We believe future ethics are embodied in the experimental, the cerebral, the intentional, the radical: sounds and words that break with convention and at times simply break. Although the music itself is at the core of Future Ethics, we believe all participants within the community—from those dancing their souls out at the front to those having important conversations in the back—are valuable pieces of a whole. We hope to bring together and give platforms to artists of different mediums who share our goals to create and practice Future Ethics in their own terms.
